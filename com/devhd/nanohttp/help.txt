Usage: %1$s args ...

A tiny server/client used to remotely execute JavaScript in various "views"

   %1$s server [port]  // server (this will be run in the embedded application)
   %1$s host   [port]  // connect to host (the port is 8011 by default)   

At the prompt
  js-main>
you can type any js expression. It will be sent to the remote js "view" identified in the prompt.     
In the above "prompt" the remote view is "main" (this is the default).

A few things:
1) type "/foo<ENTER>" (SLASH, view name,ENTER) to switch the view to which the JS commands will
be sent. The prompt should also change to:
  js-foo>
3) type "/<ENTER>" to show remote "views"
2) type "%%<ENTER>" to show history
3) type "%%<number>" to recall history item AND re-send it
4) type "%%%%" to recall LAST item AND re-send it
5) type "%%C" to clear history
